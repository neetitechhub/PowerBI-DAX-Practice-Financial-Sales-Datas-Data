# DAX-PRACTICE-Sales-Data

**This project focused on practicing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights from a sales dataset. The following tasks were accomplished as part of the analysis:**

1. **Total Rows in Table: **Counted the total number of records in the sales table.
2. **Total Sales:** Calculated the overall sales revenue.
3. **Average Sales: **Computed the average sales per transaction.
4. **Total Profit:** Derived total profit across all sales transactions.
5. **Country-Specific Sales:** Filtered and analyzed sales for the country "France."
6. **Product-Specific Profit:** Analyzed the profit for the product category "Carretera."
7. **Sales in 2014: **Calculated the total sales for the year 2014.
8. **Units Sold in the Last 60 Days:** Tracked the number of units sold within the last 60 days.
9. **Sales on Specific Date (01/01/2014):** Analyzed sales performance on a given date.
10. **Worst Performing Products:** Identified the 3 lowest-performing products by sales.
11. **Best Performing Products:** Highlighted the 3 best-selling products.
12. **Profit/Loss Analysis:** Assessed the profit or loss for each product.
13. **Country-Wise Sales:** Aggregated sales data based on country.
14. **Profit/Loss Percentage: **Calculated the profit or loss percentage for each product.
15. **Yearly/Monthly Sales Analysis:** Generated sales reports on a yearly and monthly basis.
16. **Selected Countries Display:** Displayed selected countries as comma-separated values.

This exercise improved my skills in using DAX for advanced calculations and data analysis within Power BI, improving the ability to derive actionable insights from sales data.
